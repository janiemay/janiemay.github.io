      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>I'm Janie. I am student at UNC-Chapel Hill. I am a computer science major and would like to also major in advertising/pr. I previously attended Cape Fear Community College and earned an Associate of Science. I am from Wilmington, NC. I would love to pursue advertising/pr as my career. I have experience in public relations and marketing work through an internship with New Hanover County as their District Pr Intern. I had the privilege of working the community in this role by working for a nonprofit, Cape Fear Collective. I held the title of Social Media Manager/Intern. Working for this nonprofit flourished my desire to pursue working in the nonproft industry. I would love to continue this kind of work!</p>

        <h4>My Skills!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Creativity-<br/> Working on social media platforms and making content allowed me to tap into my creative side! I had to create new content everyday that was engaging to the audience.</li>
          <li>Interpersonal-<br/>I communicated with the Cape Fear Collective team throughout the internship and attended meetings every week to plan content and debrief plans. I also managed a social media team for half of my time at the nonproft. We made content as a team and had to communicate everyday to plan content.</li>
          <li>Leadership-<br/>I managed a social media team for many months.</li>

            <p>These two posts were made by all the social media team members, including myself. Cape Fear Collective has a great tool called the Racial Equity Dashboard, which we were able to highlight a piece of their content and include some surprising statistics on these posts. These posts allowed our followers and others to be aware of the issues in our communities.</p>

            <p>The post above was made by me. Cape Fear Collective and myself were given some information that they wanted us to spread, so I created this post to highlight a horrific statistic to make our followers aware of this issue.</p>
